**Why This Initiative**  
Currently, there is no centralized or dedicated source on Facebook or other social media platforms that provides real-time updates on cybersecurity threats specific to Aruba. When local companies experience security breaches, the public and their clients are often not notified.

I want to address this gap by creating consistent weekly or even daily posts about ongoing cyber threats targeting Aruba and the Caribbean region — including Curaçao and Bonaire. These updates will not only cover active threats but also provide practical tips for individuals and organizations to protect themselves against these types of attacks.

Raising awareness is critical, especially given the recent wave of phishing attacks (including Tycoon 2FA) that successfully breached government and other entities in the past months.

**Chosen Platform**  
For managing threat intelligence, I have selected **OpenCTI**. This platform is free, open-source, and supports a wide range of integrations and data imports. Its built-in MITRE ATT&CK framework and Docker-based deployment make it quick to set up and ideal for tracking and sharing threat intelligence in a structured, professional way.
