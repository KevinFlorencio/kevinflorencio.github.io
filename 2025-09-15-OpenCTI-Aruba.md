# Cyber Threat Intelligence for Aruba and the Caribbean

## Why This Initiative

Currently, there is no centralized or dedicated source on platforms like Facebook or other social media outlets that provides real-time updates on cybersecurity threats specific to Aruba. When local companies experience security breaches, the public and their clients are often not notified.

I want to address this gap by creating consistent weekly or even daily posts about ongoing cyber threats targeting Aruba and the broader Caribbean region, including Curaçao and Bonaire. These updates will not only highlight active threats but also provide practical tips for individuals and organizations to protect themselves against these types of attacks.

Given the increasing number of phishing attacks — including the recent Tycoon 2FA exploit — that have successfully breached government and private sector entities, raising awareness is more critical than ever.

## Chosen Platform

To manage and analyze cyber threat intelligence, I have chosen **OpenCTI** — an open-source platform that provides a structured, efficient way to gather, store, and share threat intelligence. OpenCTI supports integrations with a wide range of data sources and has built-in support for the MITRE ATT&CK framework, making it an ideal choice for this project. The platform is Docker-based, which allows for quick deployment and easy scalability.

Currently, **OpenCTI is up and running**, but I am focusing on configuring it to ensure it displays the data clearly and effectively within the OpenCTI dashboard. My primary goal at this stage is to fine-tune the platform so that it accurately represents the right data for Aruba and the Caribbean. This includes refining the integration of external data sources that are most relevant to the region, ensuring that the threat intelligence feeds contain actionable insights. Once the configuration is complete, I will be able to share localized, actionable threat intelligence that will help organizations in the region stay informed and secure.
